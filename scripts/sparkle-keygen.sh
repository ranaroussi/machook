# One-time Sparkle ED25519 keypair generation.
#
# Run locally as a project maintainer the first time you set up release
# automation. The keypair authenticates auto-update artifacts: Sparkle on
# the user's Mac verifies every downloaded build against the embedded
# `SUPublicEDKey` before installing it. If the private key leaks, anyone
# can publish updates that look legit to existing installs.
#
# Outputs:
#
#   build/sparkle-keys/ed_public_key   — paste into GitHub repo secret SPARKLE_ED_PUBLIC_KEY,
#                                        and into a build-time secret of the same name
#                                        so create-app-bundle.sh can inject it into Info.plist.
#   build/sparkle-keys/ed_private_key  — paste into GitHub repo secret SPARKLE_ED_PRIVATE_KEY.
#                                        DO NOT commit, share, or back up to a public store.
#
# The output directory is in .gitignore. Delete it once you've moved the
# keys into GitHub secrets (or your password manager).
#
# Re-running this script overwrites whatever was there. Don't — losing the
# private key means every previously-shipped install has to be reinstalled
# manually before they can auto-update again.

# Sparkle's generate_keys CLI shape:
#   (no flags)            generate (or look up existing) keypair, store
#                         private in Keychain, print public-key info to stdout
#   -p                    print existing Keychain public key only
#   -x <file>             EXPORT Keychain private key to file
#   -f <file>             IMPORT a private key file INTO Keychain
#                         (NOT "write generated key to file" — easy
#                         misread; this is the opposite direction)
#
# So the maintainer flow is two calls:
#   1. plain `generate_keys` — creates the keypair in Keychain, prints public
#   2. `generate_keys -x <file>` — exports private from Keychain to file
#
# macOS will pop a Keychain access dialog on step 1 the first time.
# Click "Always Allow" so step 2 doesn't prompt again.
